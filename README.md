  The package contains immutable value objects
  <b>PositiveInt</b> and <b>PositiveDouble</b>
  that encapsulate a positive number (any number greater than 0)
  which can be <b>int</b> or <b>double</b>.
  The value objects guarantee that their value is always positive
  and can't be changed after creation.
  They can't be created with 0 or a negative value.

  final (:error, :instance) = PositiveInt.create(someNumber);
  if (instance != null) {
    final positiveInt = instance;
    print('Created a PositiveInt, value: $positiveInt');
  } else {
    print('Error. $error');
